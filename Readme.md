# My Node.js Server ðŸš€

## Project Overview ðŸ‘€

This project is a basic web server built using Node.js and Express.js. The server handles multiple HTTP requests, serves static content, and allows basic CRUD operations on a simple dataset (users). 

### ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective
By the end of this project, the server is capable of:
- Setting up a simple Node.js server using Express.js.
- Handling different types of HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
- Serving static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
- Sending JSON responses and handling data via request bodies and query parameters.
- Implementing basic error handling and routing.

## Features

- **Static Homepage**: A simple HTML homepage styled with CSS.
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete users via `/users` routes.
- **Static Assets**: The server serves static files from the `public/` directory.
- **Routing**: Routes are organized using Express Router for easy maintainability.
